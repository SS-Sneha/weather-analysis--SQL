# weather-analysis--SQL
Analyzed a weather dataset consisting more than 8000 rows to extact meaningful insights and statistics using SQL Queries.
Tasks accomplished:
1. identified unique 'wind speed' values in the dataset.
2. Calculated when the 'Weather' was exactly 'Clear'.
3.Found the number of times the 'Wind Speed' was exactly 4 km/h.
4.handled NULL values in the dataset.
5.Renamed the 'Weather' column to 'Weather Condition' for clarity.
6.Calculated the mean value of 'Visibility' across all records.
7.Calculated the standard deviation of 'Pressure' in the dataset.
8.Calculated the variance of 'Relative Humidity' in the dataset.
9.Retrieved records where 'Snow' was recorded in the 'Weather Condition' column.
10.Retrieved records where 'Wind Speed' was above 24 and 'Visibility' was 25.
11.Calculated the mean value,minimum and maximum of each column against each unique 'Weather Condition'.
12.Retrieved records where the 'Weather Condition' was 'Fog' and 'clear'.
13.Additional queries included filtering by 'Clear' weather with 'Relative Humidity' greater than 50 and 'Visibility' above 40.
